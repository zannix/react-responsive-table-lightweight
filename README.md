              name : "Mark",
              surname: "Wilton",
              address: "Williams St. 2"
          }
      ];
  
    return (
      <LTable rows={rows} columns={columns} styles={false} />
    )
  }
}
```

## Instructions

Only two props need to be passed to the component - *columns* and *rows* (*styles* is optional and can be included to extend default styling)

*Columns* is an object denoting titles of table columns. 

*Rows* is an array of objects where keys of those objects need to match *columns* keys.
